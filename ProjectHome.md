MULTIFAN-CL (MFCL) is a fisheries stock assessment model written by Dave Fournier of Otter Research, Canada.

R4MFCL uses the statistical software R to read, manipulate, write, analyze, and plot the MFCL input and output files. One of our goals is to automate the running of stock assessments using MFCL. Additional developments are planned, and we encourage you to contribute. For example, in future we hope to facilitate translation of input and output data objects between MFCL and Stock Synthesis formats.

R4MFCL was developed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). The project was led by Simon Hoyle, and also includes code by Shelton Harley, Nick Davies, and Adam Langley of the SPC, and Pierre Kleiber of the US National Marine Fisheries Service.
